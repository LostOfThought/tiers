# Custom Tools Guide

When you require more complex command-line operations, need to process output in a structured way, or want to encapsulate reusable logic, you can create custom tools using JavaScript or TypeScript.

## Location

*   Place your custom tool scripts within the `[tools/](mdc:tools)` directory.

## Technology

*   You can write tools in either JavaScript or TypeScript.
*   The `vite-node` execution environment is available within the `[tools/](mdc:tools)` directory's context, allowing you to use modern JS/TS features and import modules. `vite-node` is pre-installed in the `tools` package.

## Execution

*   To run a custom tool, use the `run_terminal_cmd` tool.
*   Execute your script using `pnpm vite-node <script_name>.ts` (or `.js`). Remember to `cd tools` first if needed.

**Example:**

```bash
cd tools && pnpm vite-node my-custom-tool.ts --input some_data
```

This allows for powerful, custom automation tailored to the project's needs.
